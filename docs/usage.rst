Using Waffle
============

Flags and Switches can be used in templates, in views, or wrapped
around entire views. Samples can be used in templates or views but not
to wrap an entire view.

If you try to use a flag or switch that is not defined, it will
*always* be **inactive**.


Using Waffle in Jingo/Jinja2 Templates
--------------------------------------

To use a Flag in a Jinja2 template via Jingo_, you can simply do::

    {% if waffle.flag('flag_name') %}
      Content if flag is active
    {% endif %}

You can also add an ``{% else %}`` section, of course::

    {% if waffle.flag('flag_name') %}
      Flag is active!
    {% else %}
      Flag is inactive!
    {% endif %}

To use a Switch in a Jinja2 template via Jingo_, you can do::

    {% if waffle.switch('switch_name') %}
      Content if switch is active
    {% endif %}

You can also add an ``{% else %}`` section, of course::

    {% if waffle.switch('switch_name') %}
      Switch is active!
    {% else %}
      Switch is inactive!
    {% endif %}

For Samples::

    {% if waffle.sample('sample_name') %}
      Sample is active!
    {% else %}
      Sample is inactive!
    {% endif %}


Using Waffle in Django Templates
--------------------------------

To use a *flag* in vanilla Django templates, you can use the ``flag``
tag::

    {% load waffle_tags %}
    {% flag flag_name %}
      Content if flag is active
    {% endflag %}

The ``{% flag %}`` tag also supports an ``{% else %}`` section::

    {% flag flag_name %}
      Flag is active!
    {% else %}
      Flag is inactive!
    {% endflag %}

To use a *switch* in vanilla Django templates, you can use the
``switch`` tag::

    {% load waffle_tags %}
    {% switch switch_name %}
      Content if switch is active
    {% endswitch %}

The ``{% switch %}`` tag also supports an ``{% else %}`` section::

    {% switch switch_name %}
      Switch is active!
    {% else %}
      Switch is inactive!
    {% endswitch %}


To use a *sample*, just use the ``sample`` tag::

    {% sample sample_name %}
      Sample is active!
    {% else %} {# Optional `else` section #}
      Sample is inactive!
    {% endsample %}


Using Waffle in Views
---------------------

To use a flag in a view, you just need ``waffle.flag_is_active``::

    import waffle

    def my_view(request):
        if waffle.flag_is_active(request, 'flag_name'):
            # Behavior if flag is active.
        else:
            # Behavior if flag is inactive.

For switches, just use the ``switch_is_active`` method::

    import waffle

    def myview(request):
        if waffle.switch_is_active('myswitch'):
            return 'switch is active'
        return 'switch is inactive'

Because it doesn't need a ``request`` object, ``switch_is_active`` can
be used anywhere.

Similarly, ``sample_is_active`` can be used anywhere, since it does
not require a ``request`` object::

    import waffle

    def myview(request):
        if waffle.sample_is_active('mysample'):
            # Some percent of requests.


Wrapping a Whole View
---------------------

You can also wrap an entire view in a flag::

    from waffle.decorators import waffle_flag

    @waffle_flag('flag_name')
    def my_view(request):
        # View only available if flag is active.

or a switch::

    from waffle.decorators import waffle_switch

    @waffle_switch('switch_name')
    def my_view(request):
        # View only available if switch is active.

If the flag or switch is *not* active for the request, the view will
be a 404.

You can reverse either decorator with an exclamation point at the
start of the flag or switch name, for example::

    @waffle_flag('!flag_name')
    def my_view(request):
        # View is only available if flag is INactive.


Global Settings
===============

There are a few global settings you can define to adjust Waffle's
behavior.


``WAFFLE_COOKIE``:
    The format for the cookies Waffle sets. Must contain
    ``%s``. Defaults to ``dwf_%s``.
``WAFFLE_FLAG_DEFAULT``:
    When a Flag is undefined in the database, Waffle considers it
    ``False``.  Set this to ``True`` to make Waffle consider undefined
    flags ``True``.  Defaults to ``False``.
``WAFFLE_SWITCH_DEFAULT``:
    When a Switch is undefined in the database, Waffle considers it
    ``False``.  Set this to ``True`` to make Waffle consider undefined
    switches ``True``.  Defaults to ``False``.
``WAFFLE_SAMPLE_DEFAULT``:
    When a Sample is undefined in the database, Waffle considers it
    ``False``.  Set this to ``True`` to make Waffle consider undefined
    samples ``True``.  Defaults to ``False``.
``WAFFLE_MAX_AGE``:
    How long should Waffle cookies last? (Integer, in seconds.)
    Defaults to ``2529000`` (one month). See :ref:`cookies` for more
    details.
``WAFFLE_OVERRIDE``:
    Whether Flags can be controlled from the query string. Defaults to
    ``False``. See :ref:`overriding-flags` for more details.
``WAFFLE_SECURE``:
    Whether to set the ``secure`` flag on cookies. Defaults to
    ``False``.
``WAFFLE_CACHE_PREFIX``:
    Waffle tries to store objects in cache pretty aggressively. If you
    ever upgrade and change the shape of the objects (for example
    upgrading from <0.7.5 to >0.7.5) you'll want to set this to
    something other than ``'waffle:'``.
<<<<<<< HEAD
``WAFFLE_FLAG_AUTOCREATE``:
    Whether new Flags will be created automatically when used. Defaults to
    ``False``.
``WAFFLE_FLAG_DEFAULTS``:
    A dictionary of defaults for flags. Defaults to ``{}``. See
    :ref:`autocreation`.
``WAFFLE_SWITCH_AUTOCREATE``:
    Whether new Switches will be created automatically when used. Defaults to
    ``False``.
``WAFFLE_SWITCH_DEFAULTS``:
    A dictionary of defaults for flags. Defaults to ``{}``. See
    :ref:`autocreation`.
``WAFFLE_SAMPLE_AUTOCREATE``:
    Whether new Samples will be created automatically when used. Defaults to
    ``False``.
``WAFFLE_SAMPLE_DEFAULTS``:
    A dictionary of defaults for flags. Defaults to ``{}``. See
    :ref:`autocreation`.
=======
``WAFFLE_CUSTOM_SEGMENT``:
    String with python path to Django form class. In this form you can define
    number of fields and form class method called ``flag_is_active``. In this
    method you can implement any logic that puts user into a specific user
    segment. ``flag_is_active`` will be called with ``flag``, ``request`` and
    ``data`` arguments. ``flag`` is instance of ``Flag``, ``request`` is Django
    request object and ``data`` is a dict specified in flag's
    ``custom_segment`` field, all fields are validated with this form.

.. _overriding-flags:

Overriding Flags
================

Waffle lets you override flag values with the querystring. You can
either enable this for all flags using the ``WAFFLE_OVERRIDE`` setting
or you can enable it per-flag with Testing property.

This only works for flags---Switches cannot be overridden at this
time.

The querystring parameter will be ``dwft_<name_of_flag>``. For
example, if I have a flag named "ab_testing", then I can override the
setting with these urls:

* http://example.com/?dwft_ab_testing=0 -- Off
* http://example.com/?dwft_ab_testing=1 -- On

.. Note::

   When you override a setting, it's persisted in a cookie in your
   browser. So once you override it, that value sticks until you
   either override it with a different value or remove the cookie.


WAFFLE_OVERRIDE
---------------

If you turn on the ``WAFFLE_OVERRIDE`` setting, you can guarantee a
flag will be active for a request by putting it in the query string.

For example, if I use the flag ``example`` in a view that serves the
URL ``/search``, then I can turn on the flag by adding ``?example=1``
to the query string, or turn it off by adding ``?example=0``.

By default, ``WAFFLE_OVERRIDE`` is off. It may be useful for testing,
automated testing in particular.

``WAFFLE_OVERRIDE`` let's you overrides **all** flags.

.. _autocreation:

Autocreation with defaults
--------------------------

It is possible to autocreate flags. For flags, switches and samples there are
the respective ``WAFFLE_FLAG_AUTOCREATE``, ``WAFFLE_SWITCH_AUTOCREATE`` and
``WAFFLE_SAMPLE_DEFAULTS``. For each type, there's also a defaults settings.
For example for samples::

    WAFFLE_SAMPLE_DEFAULTS = {
        'special_sample': {
            'percent': Decimal(0.15)
        }
    }

It is a dictionary where every key is the name and value a dictionary with
model field defaults.


testing Property
----------------

You can enable querystring overriding on a flag-by-flag basis with the
Testing property.

.. Note::

   The Everyone property takes precedent! If you want to use the
   Testing property, you must set Everyone to "unknown".


.. _cookies:

Cookies
=======

When falling back to percentage of active users, Waffle will set a
cookie for every request, setting the flag's value (on or off) for
future requests.

If the cookie is set, its value is used (either True or False) and it
is re-set. Since cookies are re-set on every request (that uses the
flag), you do not need to set ``WAFFLE_MAX_AGE`` very high. Just high
enough that a typical returning user won't potentially flip back and
forth between off and on.


.. _rollout-mode:

Rollout Mode
============

**Rollout Mode** allows you to gradually enable a feature for all
users. In "normal" mode, a flag's value will be set in a cookie until
``WAFFLE_MAX_AGE`` whether the flag is active or not. In Rollout Mode,
an *inactive* flag will set a session cookie, and an *active* flag
will set a longer-lived cookie.

Every time a user starts a new session, they'll have a chance
(determined by the percentage of the flag) to have the feature turned
on "permanently". Once it's on, it should stay on, unless they clear
their cookies or use a different browser.

To guarantee an even rollout, it will likely be necessary to gradually
increase the flag's percentage as more and more users get stuck with
the *active* cookie.

Rollout Mode is enabled **per flag**.


Waffle in JavaScript
====================

Waffle now helps you use flags directly in JavaScript. You can create a global
``waffle`` object for your JavaScript with either the ``wafflejs`` view, or the
``wafflejs`` template tag (django) or helper (jinja).

wafflejs view
-------------
To use the ``wafflejs`` view, You need to add the Waffle URLs to your URL 
config::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        (r'^', include('waffle.urls')),
        # ...
    )

This adds a named URL route called ``wafflejs``. You can then load the
Waffle JavaScript in your templates::

    <script src="{% url wafflejs %}"></script>

wafflejs tag/helper
-------------------

To use the tag or helper, simply call it from within a ``<script>`` block in a 
template. This removes an extra HTTP request for the ``wafflejs`` resource.

Django tag::

    <script type="text/javascript">
    {% wafflejs %}
    </script>

Jinja helper::

    <script type="text/javascript">
    {{ waffle.wafflejs() }}
    </script>

If using Jingo_, you need to add ``waffle`` to your ``JINGO_EXCLUDE_APPS``
for the ``waffle.js`` template to render.::

   JINGO_EXCLUDE_APPS = (
       'waffle',
   )

Use the waffle object
---------------------

Once you've loaded the JavaScript, you can use the global ``waffle``
object.  Just pass in a flag name. As in the Python API, if a flag or
switch is undefined, it will always be ``false``.

::

    if (waffle.flag_is_active('some_flag')) {
        // Flag is active.
    } else {
        // Flag is inactive.
    }

    if (waffle.switch_is_active('some_switch')) {
        // Switch is active.
    } else {
        // Switch is inactive.
    }

    if (waffle.sample_is_active('some_sample')) {
        // Sample is active.
    } else {
        // Sample is inactive.
    }

``waffle.sample_is_active(foo)`` will return the same value *on a given
request* but that value may not persist across multiple requests.
